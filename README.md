# ConnectFour
Non-GUI version of the game written in C#.

This project is a visually interactive, text-based Connect Four game implemented entirely in C#. Players control the game using keyboard inputs within a command-line interface, and the board is dynamically rendered with text-based visuals. The gameplay features engaging animations, such as pieces sliding into position, providing an immersive experience without relying on graphical elements. Additionally, the program includes three distinct levels of AI logic for computer opponents, allowing players to choose their desired level of challenge. This functionality highlights the depth of strategy and thought put into the game's design, making it as intellectually engaging as it is visually dynamic.
