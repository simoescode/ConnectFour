# ConnectFour
Mostly non-GUI version of the game.

A hybrid program that begins with a simple GUI interface for initial setupâ€”allowing players to enter their name, select turn order, and choose difficulty levels if playing against the computer. Once the game starts, it transitions to a visually interactive command-line interface where players control the action using the keyboard. The gameplay features dynamic text-based visuals, such as the pieces visibly sliding into position on the Connect Four board, creating an immersive and lively experience despite the non-GUI environment.
